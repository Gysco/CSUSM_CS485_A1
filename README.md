Assignment 1 for CS485 @ CSUSM Jan. 2018 by Zackary Beaugelin

## Flappy Bird

For this game I followed the [Live Tutorial made by Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/project-goals?playlist=17093) using their assets. I never used Unity before, so I thought learning to make a 2D game was a good start.

 The infinite loop was made by using 2 backgrounds: when one go out of the screen it come back to the end of the second. The game uses the same process for the 5 columns. They are using a randomising script for the columns that can be reuse for other purpose.

### How to play
Press the RMB to flap.

### Goal
Avoid the columns and go as far as possible.

## Super Meat Boy
After learning the base principles of the 2D engine, I decided to create a level in the spirit of Super Meat Boy.

### How to play
- Directional arrows to move
- Space to jump

### Goal
Reach the end of the level without dying.
